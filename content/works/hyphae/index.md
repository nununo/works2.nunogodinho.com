Hyphae are the cell filaments that create the mycelium, the vegetative part of a fungus. They grow and subdivide in all directions in search of nutrients needed for its development.

"Hyphae" is a generative video in which a computer algorithm draws infinite iterations of unique organisms inspired by Rhizopus stolonifer, a kind of bread mold, simulating its evolutive and reproductive process.

Hyphae was exhibited at:

* [Guest work at Isabel Garciaâ€™s exhibition Matriz at Galeria Serpente](https://works.nunogodinho.com/matriz-exhibition/) (2019)

This project was developed in C++ using [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) and its source code is available [here](https://github.com/nununo/ofHyphaeApp).
