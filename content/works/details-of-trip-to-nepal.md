_Photographs (50x50cm), color_

A collection of pictures which are details of photographs taken during a trip to Nepal. The details are 9×9 pixels of the original photograph, with a title describing what it details from the original photograph.

The explicitly figurative titles trigger the imagination of the viewer into trying to imagine the original photograph. But while these few pixels provide enough information for the viewer to believe the pixels are indeed an image (and not some random colors), they’re not enough to clearly identify what is described.
