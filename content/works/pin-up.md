_Generative video (16:9 vertical), color, 19” LCD screen, variable duration_

Pin-up girls always look at us. And they all look the same. Using about 100 photos of a pin-up girl this generative video slowly melts several bodies of a pin-up girl into a single multifaceted body which still insists in sharply gazing at us. Being generated by an algorithm in real time this video never repeats itself and evolves forever.

It was developed using the [vvvv][1] framework and I’d like to thank the vvvv community for their contribution to this project.

It should be presented in a widescreen 15.4″ TFT screen in portrait orientation.

Here’s a video sample:

And here are some frames from the video:
