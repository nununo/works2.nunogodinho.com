The audio piece «Emoções» (Emotions) is the result of a Workshop with Hugo Brito in ArCo. I started by filming footage of 4 drawings and then it evolved from there.

With that initial footage I made this film:

TODO VIMEO

After several intermediate steps, I ended up with an audio piece (much to my surprise). It can be heard here:

TODO AUDIO

The audio piece was generated on [Max/MSP][1] using a Behringer fader controller.

It was shown in ArCo 2005 annual student exhibition in Almada, Portugal.
