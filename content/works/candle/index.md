_Interactive video (16:9 vertical), color, no sound, variable duration, 24‚Äù LCD screen in black frame (70x50x10cm)_

Just like a real candle, but flat.

This is an interactive candle. A video shows a candle calmly burning. If someone blows on the screen the candle flickers or, if the blow is strong enough, it is blown out.

A video of someone interacting with the Candle:
{{< vimeo 237044360 >}}

Some frames of the interactive video:
{{< gallery "frames/*" >}}

Technicalities: two bend sensors capture the air movement around the frame. Their signals are sent to a custom-made amplifier and then fed into an [Arduino][2] which finally sends them to a [Raspberry Pi][3] which is responsible for generating the video based on the sensor data. The code can be found in [GitHub][4].
