I was invited by Salão de Beleza Bela to make a contribution to their Banality Show in Bela TV. The challenge: to make a video telling a story as uneventful as possible.

**Viagem** can be previewed here:
{{< vimeo 51829482 >}}

The piece was created in 2011. First I spent some days reflecting on what is a story, what is an event, and what are the relationships and interdependencies between both these concepts. I realised that, unlike most of my work, this one would not be the result of an iterative process comprehending experiments, failures and detours.
This story would not be created, but found. This is the story I found.

An English title for "Viagem" would be "Journey".
