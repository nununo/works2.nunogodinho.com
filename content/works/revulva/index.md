Putting things out of context was always fundamental to pornography.
<!--more-->

Not only has this decontextualization existed since its inception, but it has also gradually increased as the genre has evolved. The first pornographic movies already showed the physical sexual relation devoid of any emotional context. While early movies always showed the actors’ whole bodies, later on, partial details started to be shown. More recently, the genre accepted the idea of getting rid of whole bodies, portraying only their parts, thus rendering the human body out of context. But even the representation of detailed body parts still invokes some organic resonance. By rotating a human sexual organ around an arbitrary fixed axis – an impossibility in human terms – this work gets rid of any trace of human plausibility.
