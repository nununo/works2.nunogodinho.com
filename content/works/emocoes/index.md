The audio piece «Emoções» (Emotions) is the result of a Workshop with Hugo Brito in ArCo. I started by filming footage of 4 drawings and then it evolved from there.

With that initial footage I made this film:

After several iterative steps, I ended up making this audio piece:
{{< audio "audio/emocoes.mp3" >}}

The audio piece was generated on [Max/MSP][1] using a Behringer fader controller.
