Multi-site-specific sound piece about displacement which attempts to combine the sounds of Lisboa with the sights and sounds of another place.
<!--more-->

Having recorded several binaural field recordings in different places in Lisboa, each one is placed in its own box with an audio player and headphones. These boxes are then placed around different sites, each one matching a similar space in Lisboa.

When you put on the headphones, what you see is still the place you’re in, but the sound will transport you elsewhere.

Here are two examples of sounds. Being binaural recordings, they only work if you use headphones, speakers will not create the desired immersive effect.
