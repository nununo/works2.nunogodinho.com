Flesh melting over melted flesh. Flesh doing what flesh does.

Gel is a 1’50” loop based on found footage of a movie called [Millionaire][1] published by Private. Even though the footage is porn, Gel is not.

Soundtrack by Hugo Brito and Nuno Godinho.

Gel can be previewed here. But please remember this is a low quality version and the real work is supposed to be see in a large scale video projection.
