**@ Galeria Serpente**

Isabel Garcia invited me to participate in her exhibition Matriz which was held in [Galeria Serpente][1] in Porto, Portugal in March 2019.

Isabel's work in Matriz consisted of several bread-shaped bronze sculptures, drawings made using those sculptures as stencils and a bronze and paper sculpture made in collaboration with [Filipa Dias][2].

I made a generative video called [Hyphae][3] which was presented in a 50â€³ LCD screen. The video was being generated in real time.
