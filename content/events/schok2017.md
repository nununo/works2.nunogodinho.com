**@ Schoorl, Netherlands**

In June 2017 I created [Elsewhere][1], an audio piece, to participate in [Schok 2017][2] which happened in Schoorl, Netherlands.

Seven Elsewhere audio boxes where placed in several public locations of the village and left unattended. Passers-by could pick the headphones and engage with the work. They would hear a binaural recording of a place in Lisboa which was topologically similar to the one they were in. The recorded sounds mixed with the surrounding sounds creating an uncanny sense of displacement.
