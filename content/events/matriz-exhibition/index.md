Isabel Garcia invited me to participate in her exhibition Matriz which was held in Galeria Serpente in March 2019.
<!--more-->

Isabel's work in Matriz consisted of several bread-shaped bronze sculptures, drawings made using those sculptures as stencils and a bronze and paper sculpture made in collaboration with Filipa Dias.

I made a generative video called [Hyphae][2] which was presented in a 50â€³ LCD screen. The video was being generated in real time.

I would like to thank Isabel Garcia for having invited me to participate in her exhibition and [Galeria Serpente][1] for all their help.
