A one-night indivitual exhibition of the Hyphae prints at MILL.
<!--more-->

I have collaborated with [MILL][5] (Makers In Little Lisbon) in the past (they help me build both the [Candle][2] frame and the [Elsewhere][3] boxes) and admire their project so I was happy to accept.

Since MILL works with many media artists, a lot of the people that attended were particularly interested in the interception between art and technology. Like me.

The original [Hyphae generative video][6] which was the source of the Hyphae prints presented here was shown, although in an informal way, just for documentation purposes.
