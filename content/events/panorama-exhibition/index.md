> This group exhibition of Portuguese emerging artists aims to present the artistic potential of names that have not yet get into the art market. Meaning, creators in the field of Visual Arts that are not represented by art galleries in Portugal, although they have already a consistent and pertinent work which worth to be known.

I presented two pieces: the interactive video installation [Vela][2] and the sculpture [Também Isso Passará][3].
