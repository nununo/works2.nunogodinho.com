Associação Castelo d’If organised this collective exhibition to celebrate 7 years of existence of the Aberturas de Ateliers de Artistas. As someone who has always participated in this event, I was invited to exhibit some of my work.

The exhibition took place in [Sociedade Nacional de Belas Artes][2], in Lisboa, and was open from April 20th to May 6th 2017.

I presented two pieces: a video called [Acting Naturally][3] and a photo collage called [Lisboa, 1962][4].
