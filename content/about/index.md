#### Biography

Nuno Godinho (1973), was born in Angola. Today he lives and works in Lisboa. In 1996, he graduated in Computer Science from Instituto Superior Técnico. Later, in 2010, he completed the Video and Moving Image Course in Ar.Co.

His work focuses on video (particularly generative video) but he also produces photography, sculpture, interactive installation, and audio. Given his degree in Computer Science, it is not uncommon for his creative process to make use of computer programming.

He is a co-founder of [Atelier Concorde][1] of which he is an associated artist. Since 2010 he has participated in several collective exhibitions in Portugal and abroad.
